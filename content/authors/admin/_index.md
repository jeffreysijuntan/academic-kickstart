Hi, I am Jeffrey Tan, a third-year undergrad at the University of Virginia majoring in computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Guangzhou, China, a city known as the origin of the language Cantonese. Unfortunately, although borned and raised in Guangzhou, I do not know how to speak Cantonese. :)  

I am a researcher in computer vision. I worked at UVa Vision Lab under [Professor Vicente Ordenez](http://vicenteordonez.com). We are working on
unsupervised learning of image representations through image patches.

Last summer I worked at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)'s natural language processing team. I helped build the entity linking system that process billions of posts on Facebook each day. I have always dreamed of serving the entire world with technology and working at Facebook was a realization of that dream. I am grateful for the friends I have made and the insights I have gained during my great time there.

I am a brilliant bathroom singer and a not-so-bad guitar player. My journey of playing guitar is hugely inspired by Ed Sheeran, who can be perform like a whole band himself with just a guitar and a loop-pedal. I myself owns an Martin's Ed Sheeran Signature Guitar. Here is a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av39835314?from=search&seid=16579860154516860305) of me singing Thinking out loud by Ed Sheeran.
